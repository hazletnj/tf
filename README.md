## Motivation

When you’re stuck in a situation where you really need to go but no toilets are in sight, what do you do?

You know that there is one in the nearby mall, but you are too anxious to use the toilet to roam about before you find it, what do you do?

You finally found a toilet! But to your horror, you notice soiled toilet paper scattered all around the toilet and the cubicles, what do you do?

## Aim

We hope to create a user-friendly app for individuals to find out the locations and directions to their nearest preferred restrooms.

## Scope of Project

The ToiletFinder app is GPS-based and seeks to locate nearby toilets for users using their location. It provides the following information:
1. Navigation (Route) to each toilet (represented by markers on the map)
2. Cleanliness Rating of the Toilet by other Users (Users will be prompted to give a review upon visiting the toilet)

## Frameworks:
* Database (Google Firebase - Realtime Database)
* Maps (React Native Maps, Google's Directions API)
* Geocoding (Google's Geocoding API)
* ReactNative- (Base, Navigation, Directions, Maps, Geocoding)
* Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup)

## How are we different from similar platforms?
As of now, applications available for download in the AppStore/PlayStore are developed by overseas companies (mainly UK). This meant that the toilet finder apps are not localised to Singapore’s context - ignoring toilets in coffee shops, train stations. 

These applications are also missing 2 key features
1. Ratings on the cleanliness of the toilet.
2. Feedback system for Developers
