## Setting Up  
### Prerequisites  
* JDK 8 or later
* Android Studio
* Node 8.3 or later
* Python2
* An IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
### Setting Up the Project in your Computer
* Fork this repo and clone the fork to your computer.
* Open a console in the folder of the cloned files.
* Run npm install.
* Run the following dependencies:
  * npm install react-native
  * npm install react-navigation
  * npm install native-base
  * npm install react-native-maps
  * npm install --save firebase
  * react-native-searchable-dropdown
* After running each dependency after npm install react-native, link each dependency to react-native using the keyword **link**.
* An example would be `react-native link react-navigation` or `react-native link firebase`
* Open Android Studio and Run the Emulator.
* Run the command `react-native run-android` in the console to link the emulator to the IDE. It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. This will generate all resources required by the application.

## Design

### Architecture

App.js has only one class called App. It is responsible for,  
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

#### General Starting Flow

`App.js -> Setup.js -> app.js -> homescreen.js` 

#### HomeScreen Container

The container consists of 2 searchable dropdown menus which are part of react-native-searchable-dropdown and a button from react-native.

* The HomeScreen allows users to:
 * Select a toilet's location from the database.
 * Utilises `react-navigation` to navigate to the MapScreen that displays the toilet's data.

#### MapScreen Container

The container consists of a global map part of react-native-maps, as well as a database of the toilets' location from Google's Firebase: Realtime Database.

* The MapScreen allows users to:
 * View the location of all registered toilets on the database on the global map.

## Implementation

### Searchable DropDown Menu
* Toilet's Address & Toilet's Place

We made use of react-native-searchable-dropdown module to implement the search boxes for toilet's place and toilet's address by passing in an array of data.

The array of data is built by retrieving data from Google's Firebase: Realtime Database.

### WebScraping using BeautifulSoup

We used a Python package module called BeautifulSoup to parse HTML documents where we then extract data out of it.  
The URL of the website is: https://www.toilet.org.sg/loomapdirectory  
We extracted 272 entries of toilet data with each entry containing information such as the toilet's name, address and place.  
* E.g. AMK Bus Interchange, 53 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 S(569933), Bus Interchange

### Conversion of String Addresses to Coordinates

We made use of react-native-geocoding and Google's Geocoding API to convert our string address to coordinates which are then used in MapScreen.js to display the toilet markers on the global map.

## Documentation
We use Markdown as it is easy to read and write, and it is known to be the easiest way to write rich format documents without ever touching code or toolbars. The syntax is so straightforward that it can be understood and learnt by virtually anyone.

### Creating Documentation
A `.md` file can be easily created on GitHub, in any repo by ending the name of the file with `.md`. 
Thereafter, you can simply pull into your `local` from github.

### Editing of Documentation
Similarly, markdown documents can be edited through GitHub as well by clicking on the "pen" icon on the top right corner of your repository.
